# like_keras

A python library for robotics like like keras


### Frusterations with existing systems

- using xacro with urdf
- Having to have 5 terminals open, and juggle 10 moving parts
- Ros stack with 50 components


### Moments of inspiration

- The ease of use of pytorch
- The ease of use of gym api
- Robotics moving towards more end to end models, at some point may just be a single connected neural net
- Making launch files with python vs xml, and being able to hack it, add custom functions, etc. (ie use the full power of python)


### Design Goals

- Python first. Forget the yaml config files, lets use python with type hinting and functions. 
- Make Launching the system as easy as running a python script
