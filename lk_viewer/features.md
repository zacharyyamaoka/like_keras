- Ability to make sub graphs
    - As soon as I tried to program this in Miro I cannot beacuse I am not able to zoom in and out properly!!!


    - Here are 3 start ups around the c4 Model

- Should be easier to move components around to different groups. I wish it would auto join like miro..

- Should be no predfined levels you should be able to start at any level and zoom in and out as much as you want. I want more of a sketch pad than a predfined c4 model right now...

- COnnects from the field above should be automatically added unless you want to get rid of them..

- You should be able to open as deeply nested as you want..
- Zoom focus vs zoom expand

- I don't like how its very structured, I want more of a sketch pad



Ice Graph Features:

- Reuse accross diagrams:

I don't like
- How I cannot add random comments to the layout!!! like in miro...

    - I like how they make the nodes that are inactive in the time series fade out.
