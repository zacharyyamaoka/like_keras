- As you zoom in more it doesn't automatically expand. I think this is actually nice
- When you do expand the nit exapnds the inside, and hides the other layers (this is following c4 convention)
- I think I can support two types of expands, expand isolate and just expand
- I don't like how you need to add the nodes on the otuside agian



- Ok the zoom in alot doesn't really work well beacuse then all the other components become really small!
- I do like expand and collapse
- Its like a drop down table thing
- Its essential what instrinic does, you create groups, and you can create groups within groups. I want thoose groups to not just be meaningful but also for the subcomponents to then become sub children..
