I started with examples/basic/ex_01_cartpole

But now I want to cut back to make it even simpler!

First lets just get an agent that can beat this thing at all!

Ok what am I doing right now?

Well I am trynig to get to the point were I have a conrete objective function. then I can start a background agent and let it work away until thats met

this is super exicting how you can do auto rl on basically any MDP problem?

Beacuse the reward just becomes the top level, and then we will implement as much back end as we need!

- Make the Env harder... code more.. its just a circilum essentially! very cool :)
