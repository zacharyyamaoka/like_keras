Big Ideas:

- We want to be working at a higher level of abstraction. in terms of features, and system design and then letting the AI worry much more about the implementations and the hows
- Imagine this use case
- We first describe fairly concretely the system design and apis for a bunch of different use cases
- We also have tests that determine if the use cases are working succesfully or now
- We then get the ai to "compipile" the entire code base... crazy! its like joint optimization in feature space, to meet all the different constraints. We can turn product design into optimization. We need some type of structure to optimize, we need a goal

As I went to go describe the system I realised that mabye the tools are lacking?
