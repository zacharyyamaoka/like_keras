# Naming Conventions - "As simple as possible, but no simpler"
- Prefer descriptive variable names that are self-explanatory
- Use abbreviated names only when space is limited or when the variable is repeated frequently
- Examples:
  - `curr_observation` is preferred over `current_observation` (good balance of clarity and conciseness)
  - `obs` is acceptable only when space is limited or the variable is repeated often
  - Avoid overly short names like `co` that require mental translation
  - When in doubt, err on the side of clarity over brevity
