# Testing Philosophy
- Prefer a few really good illustrative tests over many mediocre ones
- Avoid having more tests than code - focus on quality over quantity
- Write simple code that obviously works and doesn't need extensive testing
- Tests are important for preventing regression and ensuring reliability
- Tests should be non-flaky and give the same result every time
- Tests should have deterministic behavior - like a lookup table where input always produces the same output
- Tests should be clear and illustrative - they should demonstrate the intended behavior
- Tests should be automated and not require human in the loop to visually confirm result
- Unit tests go inside the packages they test (in a `tests/` subdirectory)
- Unit tests should not depend on other packages - keep dependencies minimal
- Multi-package/integration tests go in the `tests/` directory at the workspace root
- Each test should be independent and not affect others
- Tests should verify correctness not just regression. Its easy to catch regressions with this system, you change anything it will fail lol!
